## The Gnosis application

An intelligence API, which works as a proxy to the OpenAI Chat Completion's API, and the Deepgram Voice Agent API.

When a user sends a chat completion or connects to the agent, we hijack the config and insert function/tool call configuration. When tool call requests come back from the upstream service, we intercept it, run our built-in tool calls, response to the service, and then resume the standard proxy.

This may sound like a blocker to conversational experiences by introducing a delay, but in practice with speedy services like Algolia and GitHub search, we have had exceptional early results.

We shall also be using RAG, searching our OpenAI Storage for relevant blocks of information.
